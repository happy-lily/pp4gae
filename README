#usage
    make you have installed python, Google App Engine SDK
    prepare:
	download web2py from http://web2py.com/examples/default/download
	unpackage web2py
	cp -r ~/pp4gae ~/web2py/applications/
	cp ~/web2py/applications/pp4gae/app.yaml ~/web2py/
	cp ~/web2py/applications/pp4gae/routes.py ~/web2py/
    
    run locally:
	cd ~/web2py
	python2.5 $GAE_DIR/dev_appserver.py ./
	# visit http://localhost:8080/
	
    deploy to appspot.com:
	rm *.w2p # and any other apps under applications/ GAE don't needs these, better this way
	vim app.yaml 
	# change "application: pp4gae" to "application: your_app"

	python2.5 $GAE_DIR/appcfg.py update ./
	# http://your_app.appspot.com might won't work right away,
	# GAE sever needs some time to index the database,
	# so wait and check again

    after deployed successfully:
	login with email:"admin",password:"admin"
	change your password and edit your information
	next time login with your email and new password
    NOTES:
	1. "python web2py.py" works, but admin won't work on this, caused by GAE
	2. I suggest don't change the directory name "pp4gae", it may cause pp4gae not work, unless you modify routes.py accordingly 
    3. (add more later)
